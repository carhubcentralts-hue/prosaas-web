# Voice Demo Files

This folder should contain the demo audio files for each voice.

## Expected Files

Place the following MP3 files in this directory:

- `alloy.mp3` - Alloy voice demo
- `ash.mp3` - Ash voice demo
- `ballad.mp3` - Ballad voice demo
- `coral.mp3` - Coral voice demo
- `echo.mp3` - Echo voice demo (default voice)
- `sage.mp3` - Sage voice demo
- `shimmer.mp3` - Shimmer voice demo
- `verse.mp3` - Verse voice demo
- `marin.mp3` - Marin voice demo

## How to Add Demo Files

1. Generate or record audio samples for each voice
2. Save them as MP3 files with the names above
3. Place them in this `voices` folder
4. The Voice Demo component will automatically detect and play them

## Note

If audio files are missing, the UI will display "דמו בהכנה" (Demo in preparation) instead of playing audio.
